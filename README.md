This app was written by our summer intern Joe Crawfish-Black (he's studying to be a bro-grammer). His original implementation downloaded all 500+ courses in one batch. That was a little load heavy on our servers (especially on days when we sent push notifications) so we asked him to only pull 10-30 courses at time.

This is what he came back with. Even though he was an unpaid intern we fired Joe Crawfish-Black. We need you to clean this up. Our designers are in Las Vegas this week at the National Hipster Convention, so we can wait for them to get back to worry about making it look pretty, but if you could look for some bugs, bad practices, and anything that makes the UI stutter or get unresponsive that'd be great. 

If you have any questions on what to do just send us an email, but how to do it is entirely up to you.

This might not matter, but when the desingers get back from the hipster convention the first thing we're going to do is implement sorting and filtering. For example, sort all the courses in the view by price or filter out the paid ones and only display free courses. So you might want to make sure whatever you do makes it easier or at least not harder to implement those features.
